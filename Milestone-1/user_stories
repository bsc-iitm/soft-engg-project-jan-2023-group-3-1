Milestone 1:- 

The identified users for the problem statement are Students, Support Staff and Admins. They are categorized as primary, secondary and tertiary users respectively. 

Student: 
As a student, I want to be able to create a ticket for my specific concern or query, so that I can continue learning without any technical and administrative difficulties since this is an online degree. 

Support Staff:
As a member of the support staff, I would want to solve all the tickets which are addressed to me and notify the student post resolving, so that the student can clear his inhibitions and continue learning. 

Admin:-
As an admin, I want to be able to create a dynamic FAQ list, so that it will be useful to future students and also decrease the burden of tickets on the support staff.
